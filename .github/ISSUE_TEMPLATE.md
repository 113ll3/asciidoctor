If you've arrived here to ask a question about how to use Asciidoctor or the AsciiDoc syntax, please direct your question to the #users stream in the project chat at https://chat.asciidoctor.org instead. You can learn more about the project support policy on the following page: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/about/support/

If you're here to report a bug or propose an enhancement, please run `asciidoctor -v` to verify you're using the latest patch release, which you can find in the CHANGELOG. If you're not using the latest patch release, please upgrade and retest your scenario.

Once you've confirmed you're in the right place, you can delete this message and proceed!
